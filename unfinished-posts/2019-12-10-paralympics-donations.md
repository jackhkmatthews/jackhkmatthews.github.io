## Summary

Team Sky (now Team INEOS) is a long running client of SOON\_ and during my time I was lucky enough to be the sole front-end developer involved with creating their race calender page.

## Favourite Bit

Being involved in the cross dicipline kick off meetings. During that initiation phase Product, UX, Design and Tech worked together to understand the context of a cycling team's yearly schedule and came up with how best to display that to a cycling fan.

## Tech

Angular, SCSS, TypeScript.
