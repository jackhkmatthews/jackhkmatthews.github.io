## Bio

From creating custom UIs to planning and running projects using agile methodologies, I enjoy almost all things web development. It's been four years since I started my career in tech and I'm excited to continue learning in a collaborative and creative team while making significant contributions to an interesting long term project. Iâ€™m also looking to continue expanding my skills in full-stack development and to take on more engineering and project management responsibilities.
