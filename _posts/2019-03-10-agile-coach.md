## Summary

At times on web development projects I felt my team having to come up with our own agile project management techniques and conventions. Or that the ones we were implementing weren't a good fit. To remedy this, and learn more about agile project management, I spent several weeks studying Jira's excellent [Agile Coach guide](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) and creating my own collection of [Notion pages](https://www.notion.so/soon/The-Agile-Coach-f9597550d8454978ad5a42b41bbd643a).

## Favourite Bit

Discovering that our experiences were shared by a wider community and school of thought. Whether that was shared pain points or techniques we had found to be useful.

## Tech

Agile, Scrum, Jira
