## Summary

After working with lazy loaded responsive images for some time, I decided to conduct a technical audit of the different approaches Iâ€™d come across working on projects of clients and my own. I created a Polymer playground project to better demonstrate the pros and cons of each approach and my conclusions.

## Favourite Bit

Recognising that even when `<div>`s and `<img>`s have the same intrinsic dimensions and styling, they will be rendered differently, which can in turn be overcome by using SVG data URIs as `src`s. As a result, placeholder content can always match the dimensions of the image, which is waiting to be loaded.

## Tech

Polymer, Intersection Observer, src-set, `<picture>`
