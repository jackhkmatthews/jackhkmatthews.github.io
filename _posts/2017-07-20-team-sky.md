## Summary

Team Sky (now Team INEOS) is a long running client of SOON\_ and during my time at SOON\_ I was lucky enough to be involved in creating their race calendar page.

## Favourite Bit

Being involved in the cross discipline kick off meetings. During that initiation phase Product, UX, Design and Tech worked together to understand the context of a cycling teamâ€™s yearly schedule and came up with how best to display that to a cycling fan.

## Tech

Angular, SCSS, TypeScript.
