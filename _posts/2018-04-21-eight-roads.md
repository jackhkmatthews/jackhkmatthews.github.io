## Summary

A site refresh which switched the focus from Eight Roadsâ€™ unique relationship with time to a more minimalistic but bold approach. Included an Angular front-end and django CMS / backend. The angular front-end is also SSR and includes i18n funcitonality.

## Favourite Bit

Inheriting the foundations of the project from a skilled freelancer (shout out [Jed Edwards](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jedrichards/)) and learning so much about the structuring of component scoped CSS, HTML and JS in the process.

## Tech

Angular, Angular CDK, Angular i18n, Angular SSR, SCSS, TypeScript.
