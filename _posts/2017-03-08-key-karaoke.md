## Overview

I decided to create a music based typing game similar to karaoke where the player can select a song of their choice to test their typing ability.  Hence combining my musical interests with a want to improve my typing. The player is continually displayed the number of characters hit and missed and a completion rate. The aim of the game is to keep the completion rate as near as possible to 100%.

## Favourite Bit

The intelligent on screen highlighting of correctly typed lyrics letter by letter.

## Tech

Vanilla JavaSript, jQuery, CSS, HTML.
