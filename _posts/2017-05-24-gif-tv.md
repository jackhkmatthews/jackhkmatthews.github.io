## Summary

at my job as a developer I was tasked with creating a way for a load of gifs to be looped over and projected at SOON_'s up coming third birthday party. To achieve this I created an express web server to serve info about the gifs (url, time, etc) and the assets themselves and a simple vanilla JS FE app to cycle through and render them.

## Favourite Bit

Architecting and building the complete 'vertical slice' of functionality: front-end, back-end and dev ops. Using the lower level RXJS APIs was also very interesting.

## Tech

JS, Express, gify-parse, Promises, Gifs, XMLHTTPRequest, RXJS, Funcitonal JS.
