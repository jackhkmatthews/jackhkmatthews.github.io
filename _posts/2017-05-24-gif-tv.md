## Summary

For my first project as a developer I was tasked with creating a way for a collection of GIFs to be looped over and projected at SOON\_'s upcoming birthday party. To achieve this I created an Express web server to serve info about the GIFs (url, time, etc) and the assets themselves. I then created and a simple vanilla JS FE app to cycle through and render the GIFs.

## Favourite Bit

Architecting and building the complete 'vertical slice' of functionality: front-end, back-end and dev ops. Using the lower level RXJS APIs was also very interesting.

## Tech

JS, Express, gify-parse, Promises, GIFs, XMLHTTPRequest, RXJS, Funcitonal JS.
