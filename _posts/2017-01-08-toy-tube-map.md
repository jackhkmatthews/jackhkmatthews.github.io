## Summary

For my second project on the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course I built a live Tube map, where animated tube carriages travel across London - informed by TFL's Unified API and Google's Map and Route APIs. The user can add trains to the map by selecting line, origin and destination and watch them in near real time. More can be read [here](https://github.com/jackhkmatthews/WDI_PROJECT_2).

## Favourite Bit

Via a JavaScript constructor function each train added by the user can operate autonomously outside of the appâ€™s main control flow.

## Tech

MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, gulp.js.
