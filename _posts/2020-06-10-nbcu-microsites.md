## Summary

A way for NBCUniversal to share video assets for upcoming releases with their TVOD clients. The project included a custom CMS for generating "campaign sites" with film trailer previews and download links. The CMS also enabled NBCU to password protect these sites meaning only the clients they shared credentials with could access the assets.

## Favorite Bit

By the end of the project I was the sole developer and responsible for the entire stack. Including (but not limited to) the NextJS frontend, KeystoneJS backend, app Dockerisation, Gitlab CI/CD, and the configuration of the AWS services required for hosting.

## Tech

NextJS, Chakra UI, React, React Hooks, KeystoneJS, Node.js, GraphQL, Docker, Gitlab CI/CD, Traefik, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, Cloudfront, SES).
