## Summary

The British Paralympics Association approached SOON\_ with a request to implement a donations flow on the paralympics.org.uk site. Firstly, we helped them to understand the donation tech landscape and then came up with a solution that worked for them, within budget.

## Favourite Bit

They neat way in which each stage of the donation flow is a stand alone form component with validation and state management. These independent components are orchestrated by a shared parent.

## Tech

Angular, Angular Reactive Forms, Bootstrap, SCSS, Stripe, TypeScript.
