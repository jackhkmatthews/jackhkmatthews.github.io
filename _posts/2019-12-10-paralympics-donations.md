## Summary

The British Paralympics Association approached SOON\_ with a request to implement a donations flow on the paralympics.org.uk site. We helped them first understand the donation tech landscape and then came up with a solution that worked within their budget.

## Favourite Bit

They way in which each stage in the donation flow is a stand alone form component with validation and state management. These components are then orchestrated by a shared parent.

## Tech

Angular, Angular Reactive Forms, Bootstrap, SCSS, Stripe, TypeScript.
