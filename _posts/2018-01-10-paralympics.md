## Summary

A new online hub for ParalympicsGB, combining their previous Team and Corporate sites. The project consisted of a completely new SOON\_ built CMS and a highly accessible front-end tailored for PyeongChang 2018 but with one eye on Tokyo 2020.

## Favourite Bit

Despite only being a developer for a matter of months, I was handed sole front-end responsibility for the project. Deep diving into accessibility on the web, and implementing some key accessiblity features, was also very interesting.

## Tech

Angular, Angular Material, Angular SSR, Bootstrap, Express, SCSS, TypeScript, WAI-ARIA.
