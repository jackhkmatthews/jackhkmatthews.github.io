## Summary

A new online hub for ParalympicsGB, combining their previous Team and Corporate sites. The project consisted of a completely new SOON\_ developers CMS and a highly accessible front-end tailored for PyeongChang 2018 but with one eye on Tokyo 2020.

## Favourite Bit

Being handed sole front-end responsiblity for the project dispite only being a developer proper for a number of months. Deep diving into accessiblity on the web, and implementing some key features, was also very interesting.

## Tech

Angular, Angular Material, Angular SSR, Bootstrap, Express, SCSS, TypeScript, WAI-ARIA.
