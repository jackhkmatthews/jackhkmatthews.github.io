## Summary

I worked alongside [Ed Opare-Aryee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edoparearyee/) in maintaining and adding functionality to a few Angular npm modules which Ed wrote during his time at SOON\_. These modules were made public on the npm registry and helped us reuse common patterns and functionality between our Angular projects.

## Favourite Bit

Actively working with and improving modules of code used across multiple projects and reaping the rewards when an update motivated by one project benefited an another.

## Tech

Angular, Conventional Changlog, Jasmine, Karma, npm, Standard Version, TypeScript.
