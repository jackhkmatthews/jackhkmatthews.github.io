## Summary

After working on ParalympicsGB and getting familiar with GraphQL and SSR I decided to build an Angular FE demo project. Pokedex exists to highlight some of the techniques used on ParalympicsGB and others which, in hindsight, would would have been nice to use. The app itself is a simple list and detail site for the public Pokedex GQL API.

## Favourite Bit

Using various GQL code-gen tools to generate query response TypeScript types by combining an external GQL schema and the gql fragment and query strings within the app.

## Tech

Angular, Commitizen CLI, standard-version, Angular Universal, GraphQL, GraphQL CLI, Apollo, Apollo codegen.
