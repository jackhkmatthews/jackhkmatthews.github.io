## Summary

A new phase in Phantom's long running DeepMind website project. In late 2020 I was part of the team tasked with updating the navigation, article filtering, shape rendering, content blocks and other areas.

## Favorite Bit

Finally having the time to play with Angular's animation module by following in the footsteps of the sites pre-existing animations and applying similar effects to my own newly created components.

## Tech

Angular, Angular animations, SCSS, Kintaro, Bracket, Google App Engine, Python, TSLint, Prettier.
