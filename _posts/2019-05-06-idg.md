## Summary

For my forth project on the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course I, and three other students, built an investment dashboard displaying stock prices, news feeds, exchange rates, price charts and financial models depending on which companies a user had saved to their watchlist. More can be read [here](https://github.com/jackhkmatthews/WDI_PROJECT_4_API).

## Favourite Bit

Scraping large amounts of financial data for many companies from the SEC, parsing it, saving it to our relational database and then spiting it out as wonderful JSON.

## Tech

PostgreSQL, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, AngularJS.
