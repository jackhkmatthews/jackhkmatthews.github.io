## Overview

After considering a few ideas, we decided to build a platform where a lead freelancer would be able to build a team of other freelancers to help them tackle a project which required more time or skills than the lead freelancer could handle alone.

The lead freelancer would be able to post the job and accept or reject applicants from other freelancers on the platform (of varying skill sets) until the team was fully populated. In this way the lead freelancer could construct their own small agency from project to project and capture all the benefits that come with working in a team a diverse set of skills.

We also decided that the freelancers would be organised into 9 different types (Back-end Developers, Front-end Developers, etc).
