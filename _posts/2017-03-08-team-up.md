## Overview

We decided to build a platform where a lead freelancer could build a team of in order to help them tackle a larger project. The lead freelancer can post a job and accept or reject applicants from other freelancers on the platform (of varying skill sets) until the team is fully populated. In this way the lead freelancer can construct their own small agency from project to project and capture all the benefits that come with working in a team with a diverse set of skills.

## Favourite Bit

Completing the project to a very high standard despite it being our first team project, first Angular project and first extensive use of a front-end CSS framework.

## Tech

MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, SCSS, Materialize, JavaScript, AngularJS, gulp.js.
