## Summary

For my third project on the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course I, and four other students, built a freelancer jobs board and team builder. team:up allows freelancers who require extra help on a project to construct a team and capture the benefits of working in an agency. More can be read [here](https://github.com/jackhkmatthews/WDI_PROJECT_3).

## Favourite Bit

Completing the project to a very high standard despite it being our first team project, first Angular project and first extensive use of a front-end CSS framework.

## Tech

MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, HTML, SCSS, Materialize, JavaScript, AngularJS, gulp.js.
