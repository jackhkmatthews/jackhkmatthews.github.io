## Summary

SOON_FM is SOON\_'s custom office radio station which allows people in the office to add tracks to a shared playlist. When we felt it was time for a rebuild I decided to test out some of the things I'd learned from my Agile Coach project and lead several 'Story Mapping' sessions to define and prioritise SOON_FM's desired functionality.

## Favourite Bit

Recognising that before even site maps or wireframes it is possible to almost fully describe a product of project using words and workshops. This description can then form the backbone for all future work.

## Tech

Post-it notes.
