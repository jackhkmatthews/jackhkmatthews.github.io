## Summary

SOON*FM is SOON*‘s custom office radio station, which allows people in the agency to add tracks to a shared playlist. When the time came for a rebuild, I decided to use this opportunity to employ some of the things I’d learnt from my Agile Coach project and lead several ‘Story Mapping’ sessions to define and prioritise SOON_FM’s desired functionality.

## Favourite Bit

Recognising that even without a site map or wire frame, it is possible to almost completely describe a product or project using only words and workshops. The outcome can then form the backbone for all future work and strengthen the project going forward.

## Tech

Post-it notes.
