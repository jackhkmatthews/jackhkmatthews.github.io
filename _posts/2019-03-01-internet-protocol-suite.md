## Summary

As I became a more experienced front-end web developer I found myself coming across a whole host of networking acronyms and technologies (DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, MAC, etc). I was at a loss as to how these were related to one another until I came across Wikipedia's excellent collection of [Internet Protocol Suite pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite). I decided to study these pages and created my own collection of [Notion documents](https://www.notion.so/soon/Internet-Protocol-Suite-2a86aa0c5c6e4482a42c55dc2d4db832) while doing so.

## Favourite Bit

Simply discovering the existence of a framework within which to categorise and understand a whole host of networking technologies which previously seemed so disorderly.

## Tech

MAC, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, DNS, HTTP, TLS, etc
