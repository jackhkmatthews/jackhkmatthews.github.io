## Summary

A [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) style wiki to help Klarna communicate internal workflows to their many cross-discipline teams, with a user experience that champions their brand identity. The project involved solving challenges such as multi-user editing, content block data structures and complex front-end text editing functionality.

## Favourite Bit

My highlights were implementing some beautiful designs and interactions (courtesy of [Mike Harrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/studiomh/) and [Kenneth Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawkenneth/)) and wrestling with low level web APIs to manage caret position and text selection whilst editing the appâ€™s content blocks.
