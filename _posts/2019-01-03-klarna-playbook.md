## Summary

A [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) like wiki to help Klarna communicate internal workflows to their many cross discipline teams with a user experience to match Klarna's brand identity. The project involved solving challenges like multi-user editing, content block data structures and complex front-end text editing functionality.

## Favourite Bit

A close call between implementing some beautiful designs and interactions (courtesy of [Mike Harrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/studiomh/) and [Kenneth Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawkenneth/)) and wrestling with low level web APIs to manage caret position and text selection while editing the app's content blocks.
