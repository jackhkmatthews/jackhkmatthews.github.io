## Summary

CIO work in partnership with a variety of brands to produce campaign sites which contain a collection of articles. We built a higher quality generic version which could be easily re-skinned and redeployed with new content for different brands. Included React CMS and FE instances for each campaign

## Favourite Bit

Using styled-components for the first time and implementing my own picture loading component based on the learnings from my Responsive Images project.

## Tech

Apollo, GQL, React, Styled Components, Storybook, TypeScript, Webpack.
