## Summary

SOON\_ has a company wide stand-up each morning. [Kenneth Shaw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawkenneth/) recognised the data visualisation potential and began recording each stand-up. He did so by plotting out colleagues on a circle and drawing lines between them as they spoke. The potential for this data also captured my imagination so I worked with Ken and [Vanda Gomes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vandacacaisgomes/) to create a PWA like FE, CLI client, Postgres DB and Express web server to record and display our daily stand-ups.

## Favourite Bit

Agonising over the most efficient and intuitive way to record daily stand-ups and finally coming up with a solution. Clue: to plot the next speaker you only need to know between which two previous speakers they are standing.

## Tech

Angular, SCSS, TypeScript, D3, Express, PostgresSQL, Sequalize, Node, Inquirer.
