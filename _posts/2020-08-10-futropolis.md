## Summary

An ambitious three dimensional interactive city to help demonstrate Honeywell's future city technologies. The Financial Times Partner Content site also included a collection of articles which shed more light on Honeywell's future tech.

## Favorite Bit

Although my involvement was light on this project I enjoyed seeing how far using just i18next and Google Sheets could go as an internal CMS and DB. Anytime I get to use CSS sticky is also a little plus.

## Tech
NextJS, React, i18next, react-i18next, Google Sheets, ThreeJS, react-three-fiber, SCSS modules, nginx, ESLint, Prettier, stylelint.
