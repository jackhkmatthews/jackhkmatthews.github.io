## Summary

A friend of mine recommended [CODE by Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com/code/) after I expressed an interest in understanding how computers work. I spent the following 6 months carefully studying the book while gaining an understanding of computer fundamentals and enjoying several eureka moments. To aid my learning I recreated some of the explanatory circuitry from the book as [Falstad Circuit Simulations](http://falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).

## Favourite Bit

Finishing the book. It was a serious commitment of time and effort and one I'm proud to have seen through.

## Tech
